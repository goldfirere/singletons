Note [Disable genQuotedDecs in genPromotions and genSingletons]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Somewhat curiously, the genPromotions and genSingletons functions set the
genQuotedDecs option to False, despite neither function accepting quoted
declarations as arguments in the first place. There is a good reason for doing
this, however. Imagine this code:

  class C a where
    infixl 9 <%%>
    (<%%>) :: a -> a -> a
  $(genPromotions [''C])

If genQuotedDecs is set to True, then the (<%%>) type family will not receive
a fixity declaration (see
Note [singletons-th and fixity declarations] in D.S.TH.Single.Fixity, wrinkle 1 for
more details on this point). Therefore, we set genQuotedDecs to False to avoid
this problem.

-- "Promotes" a data type, much like D.S.TH.Single.Data.singDataD singles a data

-- DataKinds automatically promotes data types and kinds and data constructors

--
-- 1. Emit defunctionalization symbols for each data constructor,
--
-- 2. Emit promoted fixity declarations for each data constructor and promoted

--    function takes these DLetDecs and promotes them (using promoteLetDecs).
--    This greatly simplifies the plumbing, since this allows all DLetDecs to

Note [Promoted class methods and kind variable ordering]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general, we make an effort to preserve the order of type variables when
promoting type signatures, but there is an annoying corner case where this is
difficult: class methods. When promoting class methods, the order of kind
variables in their kinds will often "just work" by happy coincidence, but
there are some situations where this does not happen. Consider the following
class:

  class C (b :: Type) where
    m :: forall a. a -> b -> a

The full type of `m` is `forall b. C b => forall a. a -> b -> a`, which binds
`b` before `a`. This order is preserved when singling `m`, but *not* when
promoting `m`. This is because the `C` class is promoted as follows:

  class PC (b :: Type) where
    type M (x :: a) (y :: b) :: a

Due to the way GHC kind-checks associated type families, the kind of `M` is
`forall a b. a -> b -> a`, which binds `b` *after* `a`. Moreover, the
`StandaloneKindSignatures` extension does not provide a way to explicitly
declare the full kind of an associated type family, so this limitation is
not easy to work around.

The defunctionalization symbols for `M` will also follow a similar
order of type variables:

  type MSym0 :: forall a b. a ~> b ~> a
  type MSym1 :: forall a b. a -> b ~> a

In the past, we have considered different ways to rectify this, but none of
the approaches that we have tried are quite satisfactory:

* We could hackily specify the order of kind variables using a type synonym
  like `FlipConst`:

    type FlipConst x y = y
    class PC (b :: Type) where
      type M (x :: FlipConst '(b, a) a) (y :: b) :: a

  Using `FlipConst` would cause `b` to be mentioned before `a`, which would give
  `M` the kind `forall b a. FlipConst '(b, a) a -> b -> a`. While the order of
  type variables would be preserved, the downside is that the ugly `FlipConst`
  type synonym leaks into the kind. I'm not particularly fond of this, so I have
  decided not to use this hack unless someone specifically requests it.

* We could specify the order of kind variables using the TypeAbstractions
  language extension:

    class PC (b :: Type) where
      type M @(b :: Type) @a (x :: a) (y :: b) :: a

  This is much nicer to look at than the `FlipConst` hack above. However, this
  approach has its own drawbacks. For one thing, GHC only permits using
  TypeAbstractions in an associated type family declaration if its parent class
  also has a standalone kind signature. As such, this trick would only work some
  of the time.

  Even if we /did/ give the parent class a standalone kind signature, however,
  it is still not guaranteed that the promoted method would kind-check. Consider
  what would happen if you promoted this class:

    type Traversable :: (Type -> Type) -> Constraint
    class (Functor t, Foldable t) => Traversable t where
      traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> t (f b)

  This would be promoted to:

    type PTraversable :: (Type -> Type) -> Constraint
    class PTraversable t where
      type PTraverse @(t :: Type -> Type) @f @a @b
                     (x :: a ~> f b) (y :: t a) :: t (f b)

  There is a subtle problem with this definition: because the `@f` binder lacks
  an explicit kind signature, GHC defaults its kind to `Type`. This is very bad,
  however, because `f`'s kind must be `Type -> Type`, not `Type`! Nor would it
  be straightforward to generate `@(f :: Type -> Type)`, as nothing in the
  original definition of `traverse` explicitly indicates that `f` has the kind
  `Type -> Type`.

  In theory, we could implement kind inference inside of Template Haskell to
  infer that `f :: Type -> Type`, but this is a tall order. Best to keep things
  simple and not do this.

Note [Propagating kind information from class standalone kind signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider what happens when you promote this example:

  type Alternative :: (Type -> Type) -> Constraint
  class Applicative f => Alternative f where
    empty :: f a
    ...

We want the promoted `Empty` type family, as well as the `EmptySym0`
defunctionalization symbol, to have the kind
`forall (f :: Type -> Type) a. f a`. Giving `Empty` the appropriate kind is
easy enough, as we can simply copy over `Alternative`'s standalone kind
signature to `PAltenative`, its promoted counterpart:

  type PAlternative :: (Type -> Type) -> Constraint
  class PAlternative f where
    type Empty :: f a
    ...

Giving `EmptySym0` the appropriate kind is trickier, however. A naÃ¯ve approach
would be to generate this:

  type EmptySym0 :: f a
  type family EmptySym0 where
    EmptySym0 = Empty

This would give EmptySym0 a more general kind than what we want, however, as
GHC will generalize this to:

  EmptySym0 :: forall {k} (f :: k -> Type) (a :: k). f a

This is undesirable, as now `EmptySym0` can be called on kinds that cannot have
`PAlternative` instances. What's more, if GHC proposal #425 were fully
implemented (see
https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/8443acc903437cef1a7fbb56de79b6dce77b1a09/proposals/0425-decl-invis-binders.rst#proposed-change-specification-instances),
then this code would simply not kind-check, as the left-hand side of the
`EmptySym0 = Empty` would be too general for its right-hand side.

Instead, we strive to generate this code for `EmptySym0` instead:

  type EmptySym0 :: forall (f :: Type -> Type) a. f a
  type family EmptySym0 where
    EmptySym0 = Empty

This is very doable because the user gave `Alternative` a standalone kind
signature, so it should be possible to match up the `Type -> Type` part of the
standalone kind signature with `f`. And that is exactly what we do:

* In `promoteClassDec`, we use the `matchUpSAKWithDecl` function to take the
  original class type variable binders and the class standalone kind signature
  as input and produce a new set of class binders as output, where the new
  binders have been annotated with kinds taken from the standalone kind
  signature. We will call these new class type variable binders the /full/
  binders.

* When generating a defunctionalization symbol for a promoted class method, we
  always quantify the defunctionalization symbol's kind using an explicit
  `forall`, where the `forall` looks like:

    forall <full class type variable binders> <method type variable binders>. ...

  This ensures that the kind information from the full class binders is
  propagated through to the defunctionalization symbol. (Note that we do not
  make any guarantees about the /order/ of these type variables, however. See
  Note [Promoted class methods and kind variable ordering].)

If the parent class lacks a standalone kind signature, then we skip all of this
and simply quantify the the defunctionalization symbols' kind variables in a
left-to-right order. Again, the order of these kind variables in unspecified, so
we are free to choose a simpler implementation that makes our lives easier.

Note [Using dsReifyTypeNameInfo when promoting instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During the promotion of a class instance, it becomes necessary to reify the
original promoted class's info to learn various things. It's tempting to think
that just calling dsReify on the class name will be sufficient, but it's not.
Consider this class and its promotion:

  class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -> a -> Bool

  class PEq a where
    type (==) (x :: a) (y :: a) :: Bool

Notice how both of these classes have an identifier named (==), one at the
value level, and one at the type level. Now imagine what happens when you
attempt to promote this Template Haskell declaration:

   [d| f :: Bool
       f = () == () |]

When promoting ==, singletons-th will come up with its promoted equivalent (which also
happens to be ==). However, this promoted name is a raw Name, since it is created
with mkName. This becomes an issue when we call dsReify the raw "==" Name, as
Template Haskell has to arbitrarily choose between reifying the info for the
value-level (==) and the type-level (==), and in this case, it happens to pick the
value-level (==) info. We want the type-level (==) info, however, because we care
about the promoted version of (==).

Fortunately, there's a serviceable workaround. Instead of dsReify, we can use
dsReifyTypeNameInfo, which first calls lookupTypeName (to ensure we can find a Name
that's in the type namespace) and _then_ reifies it.

Note [Promoted class method kinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this example of a type class (and instance):

  class C a where
    m :: a -> Bool -> Bool
    m _ x = x

  instance C [a] where
    m l _ = null l

The promoted version of these declarations would be:

  class PC a where
    type M (x :: a) (y :: Bool) :: Bool
    type M x y = MHelper1 x y

  instance PC [a] where
    type M x y = MHelper2 x y

  type MHelper1 :: a -> Bool -> Bool
  type family MHelper1 x y where ...

  type MHelper2 :: [a] -> Bool -> Bool
  type family MHelper2 x y where ...

Getting the kind signature for MHelper1 (the promoted default implementation of
M) is quite simple, as it corresponds exactly to the kind of M. We might even
choose to make that the kind of MHelper2, but then it would be overly general
(and more difficult to find in -ddump-splices output). For this reason, we
substitute in the kinds of the instance itself to determine the kinds of
promoted method implementations like MHelper2.

Note [No SAKs for let-decs with local variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider promoting this:

  f :: Bool
  f = let x = True
          g :: () -> Bool
          g _ = x
      in g ()

Clearly, the promoted `F` type family will have the following SAK:

  type F :: ()

What about `G`? At a passing glance, it appears that you could get away with
this:

  type G :: Bool -> ()

But this isn't quite right, since `g` closes over `x = True`. The body of `G`,
therefore, has to lift `x` to be an explicit argument:

  type family G x (u :: ()) :: Bool where
    G x _ = x

At present, we don't keep track of the types of local variables like `x`, which
makes it difficult to create a SAK for things like `G`. Here are some possible
ideas, each followed by explanations for why they are infeasible:

* Use wildcards:

    type G :: _ -> () -> Bool

  Alas, GHC currently does not allow wildcards in SAKs. See GHC#17432.

* Use visible dependent quantification to avoid having to say what the kind
  of `x` is:

    type G :: forall x -> () -> Bool

  A clever trick to be sure, but it doesn't quite do what we want, since
  GHC will generalize that kind to become `forall (x :: k) -> () -> Bool`,
  which is more general than we want.

In any case, it's probably not worth bothering with SAKs for local definitions
like `g` in the first place, so we avoid generating SAKs for anything that
closes over at least one local variable for now. If someone yells about this,
we'll reconsider this design.

Note [Keep redundant kind information for Haddocks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`singletons-th` generates explicit argument kinds and result kinds for
type-level declarations whenever possible, even if those kinds are technically
redundant. For example, `singletons-th` would promote this:

  id' :: a -> a

To this:

  type Id' :: a -> a
  type family Id' (x :: a) :: a where ...

Strictly speaking, the argument and result kind of Id' are unnecessary, since
the same information is already present in the standalone kind signature.
However, due to a Haddock limitation
(https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/1178), Haddock will not render
standalone kind signatures at all, so if the argument and result kind of Id'
were omitted in the body, Haddock would render it like so:

  type family Id' x where ...

This is unfortunate for Haddock viewers, as this does not convey any kind
information whatsoever. Until the aformentioned Haddock issue is resolved, we
work around this limitation by generating the redundant argument and kind
information anyway. Thankfully, this is simple to accomplish, as we already
compute this information to begin with.

Note [Generating type families with the correct arity]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of GHC 9.10, GHC no longer performs arity inference when kind-checking type
family declarations with standalone kind signatures. This is an important
consideration when promoting functions with top-level type signatures. For
example, we would not want to take this definition:

  f :: Either a Bool
  f = Right True

And promote it to this type family:

  type F :: Either a Bool
  type family F where
    F = Right True

GHC would reject this type family because it would expect F to have arity 0,
but its definition requires arity 1. This is because the definition of F is
tantamount to writing:

  F @a = Right @a @Bool True -- This takes 1 argument, hence arity 1

In order to make F kind-check, we need to generate a type family header that
explicitly declares it to have arity 1, not arity 0:

  type F :: Either a Bool
  type family F @a where
    F = Right True

Note the @a binder after F in the type family header.

If the standalone kind signature lacks an outermost forall, then we simply bind
the type variables in left-to-right order, preserving dependencies (using
`toposortTyVarsOf`). If the standalone kind signature does have an outermost
`forall`, then we bind the type variables according to the order in which it
appears in the `forall`, making sure to filter out any inferred type variable
binders. For example, we would want to take this definition (from #585):

  konst :: forall a {b}. a -> b -> a
  konst x _ = x

And promote it to this type family:

  type Konst :: forall a {b}. a -> b -> a
  type family Konst @a x y where
    Konst @a (x :: a) (_ :: b) = x

Note that we do not bind @b here. The `tvbSpecsToBndrVis` function is
responsible for filtering out inferred type variable binders.
