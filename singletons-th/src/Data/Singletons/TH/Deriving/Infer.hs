-- @inferConstraints cls inst_ty cons@ infers the instance context for a
-- derived type class instance of @cls@ for @inst_ty@, using the constructors
-- @cons@. For instance, if @cls@ is 'Ord' and @inst_ty@ is @Either a b@, then
-- that means we are attempting to derive the instance:
--
-- @
-- instance ??? => Ord (Either a b)
-- @
--
-- The role of 'inferConstraints' is to determine what @???@ should be in that
-- derived instance. To accomplish this, the list of @cons@ (in this example,
-- @cons@ would be @[Left a, Right b]@) is used as follows:
--
-- 1. For each @con@ in @cons@, find the types of each of its fields
--    (call these @field_tys@), perhaps after renaming the type variables of
--    @field_tys@.
-- 2. For each @field_ty@ in @field_tys@, apply @cls@ to @field_ty@ to obtain
--    a constraint.
-- 3. The final instance context is the set of all such constraints obtained
--    in step 2.
--
-- To complete the running example, this algorithm would produce the instance
-- context @(Ord a, Ord b)@, since @Left a@ has one field of type @a@, and
-- @Right b@ has one field of type @b@.
--
-- This algorithm is a crude approximation of what GHC actually does when
-- deriving instances. It is crude in the sense that one can end up with
-- redundant constraints. For instance, if the data type for which an 'Ord'
-- instance is being derived is @data Foo = MkFoo Bool Foo@, then the
-- inferred constraints would be @(Ord Bool, Ord Foo)@. Technically, neither
-- constraint is necessary, but it is not simple in general to eliminate
-- redundant constraints like these, so we do not attept to do so. (This is
-- one reason why @singletons-th@ requires the use of the @UndecidableInstances@
-- GHC extension.)
--
-- Observant readers will notice that the phrase \"perhaps afer renaming the
-- type variables\" was casually dropped in step 1 of the above algorithm.
-- For more information on what this means, refer to the documentation for
-- infer_ct below.

  where
    -- A thorny situation arises when attempting to infer an instance context
    -- for a GADT. Consider the following example:
    --
    --   newtype Bar a where
    --     MkBar :: b -> Bar b
    --   deriving Show
    --
    -- If we blindly apply 'Show' to the field type of @MkBar@, we will end up
    -- with a derived instance of:
    --
    --   instance Show b => Show (Bar a)
    --
    -- This is completely wrong, since the type variable @b@ is never used in
    -- the instance head! This reveals that we need a slightly more nuanced
    -- strategy for gathering constraints for GADT constructors. To account
    -- for this, when gathering @field_tys@ (from step 1 in the above algorithm)
    -- we perform the following extra steps:
    --
    -- 1(a). Take the return type of @con@ and match it with @inst_ty@ (e.g.,
    --       match @Bar b@ with @Bar a@). Doing so will produce a substitution
    --       that maps the universally quantified type variables in the GADT
    --       (i.e., @b@) to the corresponding type variables in the data type
    --       constructor (i.e., @a@).
    -- 1(b). Use the resulting substitution to rename the universally
    --       quantified type variables of @con@ as necessary.
    --
    -- After this renaming, the algorithm will produce an instance context of
    -- @Show a@ (since @b@ was renamed to @a@), as expected.
