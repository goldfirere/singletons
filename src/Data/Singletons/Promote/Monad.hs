This file defines the PrM monad and its operations, for use during promotion.

The PrM monad allows reading from a PrEnv environment and writing to a list
of DDec, and is wrapped around a Q.

Note [Explicitly binding kind variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want to ensure that when we single type signatures for functions and data
constructors, we should explicitly quantify every kind variable bound by a
forall. For example, if we were to single the identity function:

  identity :: forall a. a -> a
  identity x = x

We want the final result to be:

  sIdentity :: forall a (x :: a). Sing x -> Sing (Identity x :: a)
  sIdentity sX = sX

Accomplishing this takes a bit of care during promotion. When promoting a
function, we determine what set of kind variables are currently bound at that
point and store them in an ALetDecEnv (as lde_bound_kvs), which in turn is
singled. Then, during singling, we extract every kind variable in a singled
type signature, subtract the lde_bound_kvs, and explicitly bind the variables
that remain.

For a top-level function like identity, lde_bound_kvs is the empty set. But
consider this more complicated example:

  f :: forall a. a -> a
  f = g
    where
      g :: a -> a
      g x = x

When singling, we would eventually end up in this spot:

  sF :: forall a (x :: a). Sing a -> Sing (F a :: a)
  sF = sG
    where
      sG :: _
      sG x = x

We must make sure /not/ to fill in the following type for _:

  sF :: forall a (x :: a). Sing a -> Sing (F a :: a)
  sF = sG
    where
      sG :: forall a (y :: a). Sing a -> Sing (G a :: a)
      sG x = x

This would be incorrect, as the `a` bound by sF /must/ be the same one used in
sG, as per the scoping of the original `f` function. Thus, we ensure that the
bound variables from `f` are put into lde_bound_kvs when promoting `g` so
that we subtract out `a` and are left with the correct result:

  sF :: forall a (x :: a). Sing a -> Sing (F a :: a)
  sF = sG
    where
      sG :: forall (y :: a). Sing a -> Sing (G a :: a)
      sG x = x
