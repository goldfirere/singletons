-- Defines functions and datatypes relating to the singleton for '[]',
-- including a singletons version of a few of the definitions in @Data.List@.
--
-- Because many of these definitions are produced by Template Haskell,
-- it is not possible to create proper Haddock documentation. Please look
-- up the corresponding operation in @Data.List@. Also, please excuse
-- the apparent repeated variable names. This is due to an interaction
-- between Template Haskell and Haddock.
