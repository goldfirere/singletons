-- Promote a list of declarations; returns the promoted declarations
-- and a list of names of declarations without accompanying type signatures.
-- (This list is needed by singletons to strike such definitions.)

-- Promoting declarations proceeds in two stages:
-- 1) Promote everything except type signatures
-- 2) Promote type signatures. This must be done in a second pass because
--    a function type signature gets promoted to a type family declaration.
--    Although function signatures do not differentiate between uniform parameters
--    and non-uniform parameters, type family declarations do. We need
--    to process a function's definition to get the count of non-uniform
--    parameters before producing the type family declaration.
--    At this point, any function written without a type signature is rejected
--    and removed.
