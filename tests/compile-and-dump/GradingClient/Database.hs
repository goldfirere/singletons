-- Appends two rows. There are three suspicious case statements -- they are
-- suspicious in that the different branches are all exactly identical. Here
-- is why they are needed:

-- The two case statements on r are necessary to deconstruct the index in the
-- type of r; GHC does not use the fact that s' must be (Sch a') for some a'.
-- By doing a case analysis on r, GHC uses the types given in the different
-- constructors for Row, both of which give the form of s' as (Sch a'). This
-- deconstruction is necessary for the type family Append to compute, because
-- Append is defined only when its second argument is of the form (Sch a').

-- The case statement on rowAppend t r is necessary to avoid potential
-- overlapping instances for the SingRep class; the instances are needed for
-- the call to ConsRow. The potential for overlapping instances comes from
-- ambiguity in the component types of (Append s s'). By doing case analysis
-- on rowAppend t r, these variables become fixed, and the potential for
-- overlapping instances disappears.

-- We use the "cases" Singletons library operation to produce the case
-- analysis in the first clause. This "cases" operation produces a case
-- statement where each branch is identical and each constructor parameter
-- is ignored. The "cases" operation does not work for the second clause
-- because the code in the clause depends on definitions generated earlier.
-- Template Haskell restricts certain dependencies between auto-generated
-- code blocks to prevent the possibility of circular dependencies.
-- In this case, if the $(singletons ...) blocks above were in a different
-- module, the "cases" operation would be applicable here.
