description:
    @singletons@ contains the basic types and definitions needed to support
    dependently typed programming techniques in Haskell. This library was
    originally presented in /Dependently Typed Programming with Singletons/,
    published at the Haskell Symposium, 2012.
    (<https://cs.brynmawr.edu/~rae/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf>)
    .
    @singletons@ is intended to be a small, foundational library on which other
    projects can build. As such, @singletons@ has a minimal dependency
    footprint and supports GHCs dating back to GHC 8.0. For more information,
    consult the @singletons@
    @<https://github.com/goldfirere/singletons/blob/master/README.md README>@.
    .
    You may also be interested in the following related libraries:
    .
    * The @singletons-th@ library defines Template Haskell functionality that
      allows /promotion/ of term-level functions to type-level equivalents and
      /singling/ functions to dependently typed equivalents.
    .
    * The @singletons-base@ library uses @singletons-th@ to define promoted and
      singled functions from the @base@ library, including the "Prelude".
